# Stacks

> Tools matter less than **how** you use them. These are the stacks I use with clear intent.

## Rust

- Async services & crawlers
- Performance-first backend design
- Correctness via explicit types and structured modules

## AWS (Serverless)

- Lambda as compute
- S3 as source of truth (snapshots)
- DynamoDB for metadata / fast lookups
- CloudFront for fast distribution

## Web / Backend

- Actix / Django / Spring depending on constraints
- API design with predictable failure modes
- Observability-first mindset (logs, metrics, tracing when needed)

## Mobile

- SwiftUI for native UX
- Modular composition and state-driven UI

## Ops

- Docker / Nginx for predictable deployment and routing
- Git-first workflows and automation habits
